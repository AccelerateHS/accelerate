# Change Log

Notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and the
project adheres to the [Haskell Package Versioning
Policy (PVP)](https://pvp.haskell.org)

## [next]
### Added
  * Added debugging functions in module `Data.Array.Accelerate.Debug.Trace` ([#485](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/485))
  * Support for SIMD data types in expressions. Support for storing a type `a`
    in a SIMD vector can be added by deriving an instance for the class `SIMD`.
    Pattern synonyms `V2`, `V3`, `V4`, `V8` and `V16` are provided to work with
    these at both the Haskell value and embedded expression level.
  * Instances for SIMD types in basic numeric classes (e.g. `Num` for `<4 x Float>`)
  * Support for 128-bit integers (signed and unsigned)
  * Support for 128-bit floating point types (build with cabal flag `float128`)

### Changed
  * Removed dependency on lens ([#493](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/493))
  * The shape constructors (e.g. `Z` and `(:.)`) are now pattern synonyms that
    work on both Haskell values and embedded expressions Similarly for the
    constructors of `Maybe`, `Either`, `Bool`, and `Ordering`.

### Fixed
  * Graphviz graph generation of `-ddump-dot` and `-ddump-simpl-dot` ([#384](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/384))
  * Bug in `Semigroup` instance for `Maybe` ([#517](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/517))
  * Bug in `Ord` instances or tuple types

### Removed
  * Pattern synonyms `Z_`, `(::.)`, `Any_`, `All_`, which are no longer required
  * Pattern synonyms `Just_`, `Nothing_` etc., which have been renamed to no
    longer require the trailing underscore.

## [1.3.0.0] - 2020-08-26
### Added
  * Instances of `Elt` are now derivable via `Generic` for simple (Haskell'98)
    product _and_ sum data types.
  * Pattern synonyms for manipulating custom product and sum types can now be
    created; see `Pattern`, `mkPattern`
  * Added pattern synonyms for accessing tuples and indices, as an alternative
    to `lift` and `unlift`.
  * Support for pattern matching in the embedded language; see `match`

### Changed
  * The `stencil` functions now support fusion. Note however that the source
    (delayed) array will be evaluated at _every_ access to the stencil pattern;
    if the delayed function is expensive, you may wish to explicitly `compute`
    the source array first, matching the old behaviour.
  * Removed `Slice` constraint from some indexing operations
  * Improve fusion for `zipWith*` ([#453](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/453))
  * The indexing function to `permute` now returns a `Maybe` type ([#87](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/87))

  * (internal) Visible type applications are used instead of `Proxy` types
  * (internal) `EltR` is now a class-associated type of `Elt`
  * (internal) `GArrayData` has been simplified
  * (internal) SIMD representation has been improved and generalised
  * (internal) Internal refactoring ([#449](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/449), [#455](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/455), [#457](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/457), [#460](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/pull/460))

  * Probably many others I have forgotten about

### Removed
  * Drop support for GHC-7.10 .. 8.4.

## [1.2.0.1] - 2018-10-06
### Fixed
  * Build fix for ghc-8.6

## [1.2.0.0] - 2018-04-03
### Changed
  * Internal debugging/RTS options handling has been changed. Compiling this package now implies that backends are also compiled in debug mode (no need to set the `-fdebug` cabal flag for those packages as well).
  * Complex numbers are stored in the C-style array-of-struct representation.
  * Improve numeric handling of complex numbers.
  * Coercions (`bitcast`) now occur between the underlying representation types
  * Front-end performance improvements

### Added
  * Support for half-precision floating-point numbers.
  * Support for struct-of-array-of-struct representations. Currently this is limited to fields of 2,3,4,8, or 16-elements wide.
  * Add equivalents for `Data.Functor`, `Data.Semigroup` (ghc-8+)
  * Add instances and helper functions for `Maybe` and `Either` types
  * Add rank generalised versions of `take`, `drop`, `head`, `tail`, `init`, `slit`, `reverse` and `transpose`.
  * Implement counters and reporting for `-ddump-gc-stats`

## [1.1.1.0] - 2017-09-26
### Changed
  * Improve and colourise the pretty-printer


## [1.1.0.0] - 2017-09-21
### Added
  * Additional EKG monitoring hooks ([#340](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/340))

  * Operations from `RealFloat`

### Changed
  * Changed type of `scanl'`, `scanr'` to return an `Acc` tuple, rather than a
    tuple of `Acc` arrays.
  * Specialised folds `sum`, `product`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `and`, `or`,
    `any`, `all` now reduce along the innermost dimension only, rather than
    reducing all elements. You can recover the old behaviour by first
    `flatten`-ing the input array.
  * Add new stencil boundary condition `function`, to apply the given function
    to out-of-bounds indices.

### Fixed
  * [#390](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate/issues/390): Wrong number of arguments in printf
